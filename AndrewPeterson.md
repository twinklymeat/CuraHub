## About Me

My name is Andrew Peterson, I am studying Computer Science, and I work at a movie theater. I dont know what kind of job I want to get when I get out of college so I'm just going to work for the first company that hires me.

## My CSC 340 Goals

I want to learn how to do Software Engineering because there is a very high chance that I will end up doing this in some form in the future, and I like to make my own things.
